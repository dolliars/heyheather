Hey Heather! It's me AGAIN!

I have in fact fixed Kelvin. S-U-C-C-E-S-S, that's the way you spell success!
It turns out my diagnostic was *corrrect*, the issue was with the compressor
relay. I ended up picking up a 3-in-1 universal relay from an appliance repair
joint. I had naively thought that bringing the piece needing replacing would
suffice. That assumption was wrong. They needed the model of the refrigerator
which I had forgotten. Although they would've had to order the part anyway and I
didn't want to wait around for that. Enter the universal relay, capacitor and
overload device (ok so I changed more than just the relay). It cost less than
$20! When I had gone to the repair shop I overheard an employee mention that it
costs about $75 for a visit from a technician. Which is money I would rather
spend on a new used fridge if it had come to that. Had the issue been the
compressor itself, I would've switched. I shopped around a bit and saw that
those things can cost anywhere from $150 to $700. And that's not including labor
since it's [not a DIY kind of task][YT-compressor]. I mean for those prices I
could just replace the whole thing. What a waste that would be! But thankfully I
needn't worry about that anymore.

So that's out of the way now. Cooling can continue. Although I think I'm going
to leave it unplugged for a while since it's still empty. I have a temporary
hack for keeping some provisions cold where I put a few beers and jars of food
between my two back doors. It works pretty well!
