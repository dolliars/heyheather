Since I've been looking for a gig, I've read ***a lot*** of job ads. I also keep
coming across hiring managers and recruiters saying they have trouble finding
anyone to even _apply_.

Weird.

> "Join Our Family!" close tab.

> "Your Second Family!" close tab.

> "Requires a Master's in..." close tab.

> "Back to the offi..." close tab.

> "... help us reach unicorn status" close tab.

>"We just wanna be fun and quirky haha! btw you're being paid less than your
colleagues but haha foosball! Please stay late to help the family haha we'll pay
for pizza but shh! don't tell the others haha ;))"

> "Require professional ref..." close tab.

>"Because we receive an overwhelming number of applications.." mehh nvm then..
close tab.

> "We have openings for Staff, Lead, and Sen..." close tab.

>"Tell us why you wanna join our squad..." close tab.

> "Help grow a rocketship startu..." close tab.

> "Work hard, pla..." close tab.

>"Blockch..." close tab.

>"DO YOU EAT CODE FOR BR.." close tab.

<br>

I wonder why.
