Hey Heather. It's me again.

I haven't been programming. I know. I've been concentrating on musical projects.
Not really on those I want to work on though. But this is just a temporary
state. It should get better soon. Maybe I'll do a few Euler problems for fun.
Coffee and Euler: a good combination. Anyway, since I don't have any programming
notes to add, I decided to make a list of podcasts I like. I will not be
providing context. Here you go!

- [99% Invisible][podcast-99%]
- [Philosophize This!][podcast-philo]
- [The Knowledge Project][podcast-fs]
- [The Allusionist][podcast-allusionist]
- [Lore][podcast-lore]
- [Twenty Thousand Hertz][podcast-hertz]
- [Hardcore History][podcast-hhh]
- [Hidden Brain][podcast-brain]

Listening to a podcast is a great way to do chores. I find myself looking for
things to clean in order to get in some podcast time. I hope you enjoy. gl;hf.
