Hey Heather, it's me again.

I've mentioned in passing that since the start of the year I've been helping
Californians get vaccinated by volunteering with [VaccinateCA][vaccinateCA].
This past Friday, we launched our national website: [Vaccinate The
States][vaccinateStates]. It's still sorta in beta. We're working on it and
we're looking for people to help: see [this blog post][vaccinateCA-blog]. Folks
can help by doing online research, making phone calls, and by [writing
code][vaccinateCA-code].

## "Why? Do you even know people in California?"

No. Not at all actually. Honestly the only reason I have is: there's a pandemic
and I have to do something about it. I had a conversation with someone back in
January where I brought up the general situation, the slowness of our response
and the violence of it all. And I made a comparison: in the 4 years of WWI
[~67&nbsp;000 Canadian soldiers died][wiki-wwi], that's 16&nbsp;750 for each
year. In January when I checked (I believe it was around mid-January) we had a
total of ~18&nbsp;000 deaths from covid. The violence of this is appalling to
me. And this person I was talking to said something along the lines of "yeah,
well.. there's nothing anyone of us can do about it." ...

I. Definitely. Can.

I was, in a sense, disgusted by the comment. By the apathy. The resignation. I
couldn't accept it. The general attitude of the comment. After some reflecting I
decided I had to do _something_. I started a few things on my own but they
didn't pan out. It was also overwhelming and hard doing it alone. At some point
I found out about this group of people in California. Somewhere it mentioned
something about making phone calls. I immediately sent an email and got started
by the following day. Did you know I use to work at a call center? I added a
long distance package and 'hello California, it's me again...' 

After making a few calls here and there, I helped a bit with editing
documentation. Then moved on to work on the website. Generally, my contributions
have been quite modest. But I think they're important. Especially when they can
free someone up. I plan to continue making contributions whenever I can. Still
gotta maintain the day job and pace myself for energy. Continually thinking
about the pandemic can be taxing to say the least. But this is still the most
rewarding and impactful work I've done as of yet I believe.

If you want to contribute, you can check out the [Contributing wiki
page][gh-contributing]. Or you can also fill out [this form][volunteer-form]
which asks for your name, email and how you want to contribute. I'm sometimes
unsure about my impact, feeling like I should be able to do more. But when that
happens, I try to remember my visit to Mexico. I was sitting near another
tourist who, after tasting one drop of hot sauce and having a coughing fit said:
"A little goes a long way".

I can be hot sauce.
