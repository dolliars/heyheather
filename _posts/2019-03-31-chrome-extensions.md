Hey Heather, it's me again!

I'm going to build a Chrome Extension! w00t! The plan is to start small and then
build upon my work to avoid despair. I went over the [Overview
documentation][google-overview] from Google and everything seems pretty clear.
It sounds like an extension is basically a miniature website. We'll see if that
mental model holds up. The next step is to go through [Google's
tutorial][google-tutorial] which is what I'm planning to do this week. Another
resource I found helpful at explaining Chrome Extensions when it's 1:07 in the
morning and you're not _actually_ reading what you're reading was [this
video][video-overview]. Why am I still awake.
