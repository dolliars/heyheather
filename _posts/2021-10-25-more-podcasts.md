I currently have ~10 blog posts in my drafts pile. I seem to be having trouble
pushing them out. Some of them have to do with thoughts on specific themes that
I still need process, while others are haphazard explanations that I jotted down
when working on a project. In an attempt to clear the pipes, I'm just going to
post this list of podcasts. This isn't something that was in my drafts. But I
figured it'll feel like an easy win and perhaps invigorate me to write more.

Anyway, here's the list:

- [Strong Songs][podcast-strong-songs]
- [Conversations with Tyler][podcast-conversations]
- [In Our Time][podcast-in-our-time]
- [How I Built This][podcast-how-i-built-this]
- [Science Magazine Podcast][podcast-science-magazine]
- [Lingthusiasm][podcast-lingthusiasm]
