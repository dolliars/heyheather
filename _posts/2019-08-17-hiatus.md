Hey Heather, it's me again.

As you may have noticed I've been on hiatus for a few months now. I needed to
take a step back from everything after leaving my job. It was a hard decision
but as confirmation bias will have me think, I'm glad I did it. Anyway, I've
been hacking away at a few things, working with different APIs and template
engines. I'll try to write a bit more consistently. Currently I have a bunch of
questions and notes in a draft file so it's definitely not for lack of content
that posts have been sparse. Moral has taken a hit. But that should only be
temporary. Words have been written at least. They just need to make a bit more
sense before being caught up in the web.
