Hey, it's me! This is a blog where I write to my friend Heather. Sometimes about
programming things. Sometimes about other things. I tend to digress.

# Why?

For programming and prose. Also, it's weird to write to an "audience" — I have
no idea who you people are — but it's easier when I write to a friend. So I've
decided to write to my friend Heather. There. It's on the Internet. 

Heather, you don't have to read this.
