As you know, my fridge, Kelvin, has spurned its duty to keep my food cold. I had
to throw everything away except for condiments that were not mayonnaise. I was
most disappointed by having to get rid of my stash of spaghetti sauce. It's a
pretty good sauce. Today I took it upon myself to fix it. There are a lot of
other things I'd rather be doing like working, playing music, eating cold food.
But alas, I started upon this journey and must see its conclusion. I must fix
it. It remains a bit of a puzzle and that's fun. It's amazing that we have big
machines in our homes that keep our food at a slow-rotting degree temperature.
But how do they work? Or more importantly for me, how can they break?

Going over its symptoms I could narrow my Google search down. Everything seemed
fine except it wasn't blowing cold air and there was a clicking sound every once
in a while. I found [a bunch][YT-sears-1] [of great][YT-sears-2] [videos from
Sears][YT-sears-3] and [a bunch][YT-others-1] [of other][YT-others-2]
[videos][YT-others-2] [from people][YT-others-3]. And I must say, I'm very
thankful that all these people have made videos that explain and show how you
can to do a task. YouTube is great. And the people that post videos about how to
fix refrigerators are great. And so are those who post videos about different
ways to finish wood. Or videos about how to sew buttons on a coat. They give
you all these neat tips on what to look for and things that you may encounter.
It's just great. I'm really happy that this exists. That's mainly what I wanted
to say here. Just that I'm thankful for these videos and the people who post
them.

Because *dang it*, what a hassle! There's so much dust behind a fridge! Well,
mine was pretty clean compared to what I saw, but still very dusty. And I have
yet to acquire a suction device to properly purge dust. I feel so sheltered
since I don't have to deal with this every day. Anyway, after doing some
research I figured that the relay must be defective. I was so proud of myself
and confident. I had a plan: remove the relay, go to Rona for replacement part
and then install it. Easy peasy! ... It wasn't. The task wasn't difficult but if
you've never done it, you question the effort and strength your hands should
output. Am I pulling to hard on the wires? Both pieces here are black, should I
take them both off? And so on. So it took a while. Then I went to Rona and to my
surprise, they didn't have the piece! This was a first. It was near closing time
so I just went home. No piece in hand or in sight. So Kelvin is still not
working and is in a worse state because I removed the relay for the compressor.
Even if I change it, there's still a chance that the problem is with the
compressor itself. We'll see if I have better luck tomorrow!
