Hi, it's me! This is a blog where I write to my friend Heather about things. In
a perfect world, it would only be about programming things. But I digress.
Hopefully not too much.

# Whyy?
I want to become a better programmer. And how will I achieve that? By
programming more and presenting/explaining the acquired knowledge to someone.
And who is that someone? That someone is my friend Heather. I will be writing to
her about what I've been working on. My plan is to post every Sunday. There.
It's on the Internet. 

Heather, you don't have to read this.
