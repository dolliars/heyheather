Hi, it's me! This is a blog where I write to my friend Heather about things.
Sometimes about programming things. Sometimes about other things. I tend to
digress.

# Why?
I want to become a better programmer. I also want to write to someone other than
myself. So I've decided to write to my friend Heather. There. It's on the
Internet. 

Heather, you don't have to read this.
