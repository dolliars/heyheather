Hi, I'm me and this is where I write to my friend Heather about things. In a
perfect world, it would only be about programming things. But I digress.
Hopefully not to much.

# Whyy?
I'm a person who wants to be a become a better programmer. And how will I
achieve that? By programming more and presenting it and/or explaining it to
someone. And how will I do that? By blogging to Heather about it.

Heather, you don't have to read this.
