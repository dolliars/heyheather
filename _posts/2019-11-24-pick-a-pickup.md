Hey Heather, it's me again.

I'm just about finished with my guitar build. I put a lot of time in the shop
during the summer and now that the lacquer finish has set I'm about to
[solder][solder] the pickups. I don't really remember choosing the pickups
though. I may have rushed through that decision. I just remember the part where
I messed up the body using a router that went rogue on me. Anyway, I've added
the hardware to check the fit and someone said "looks like you've got a
humbucker there!". Yessiree buckaroo! ... I spent a week thinking that a
humbucker was just another term for the bridge and saddle. It's not. It's a type
of pickup. I learned a bit about pickups this week and I'm here to share this
information.

## First of all, sound.

The more I think about it, the more [sound][wiki-sound] is a fascinating and
weird phenomenon. You have this physical vibrating event that happens which
causes air molecules to move and push adjacent air molecules back and forth
until it reaches your eardrum. At that point bodily mechanisms take over
receiving the vibration and transforming it to a signal that the brain will
interpret as sound. There's *sooo much* you could get into just trying to
understand sound but let's just keep it at that for the moment.

## Pickups

Now [a pickup][wiki-pickup] is a device that transforms energy from one form to
another. A broader term for a device like this is [a
transducer][wiki-transducer]. In the case of an electric guitar, it'll take the
vibrations produced by a moving string and will convert them into an electrical
signal which is then amplified. Most of the time electric guitars will have
magnetic pickups which are wrapped in copper wire. They create a magnetic field
that magnetizes the guitar strings which are composed of some type of
ferromagnetic material. So when the string vibrates, the magnetic field around
it bends with the string. This movement affects the current that is running in
the copper coil that was wound around the magnets. For now this is as much as I
have understood of the general nature of pickups. [This video][YT-pickups] goes
into more detail on how pickups work and different things that can affect how a
guitar sounds. 

## Choosing

Now the question to ask yourself is what type of sound you want. Mostly I've
seen the answers separated into two categories: bright or warm sound. In terms
of pickups, **bright** is associated with [single-coil
pickups][wiki-single-coil], and **warm** with [dual-coil or humbucker
pickups][wiki-humbucker] although there's no hard line drawn. When I answered
the question of choosing either bright or warm my default answer was to go with
warm. This for no other reason than "I prefer the feelings associated with the
word". This was unclear to me until I looked into what the words represented in
terms of actual sound but by then I had already chosen my pickups. It's still
good to know so searching a bit I found [this video][YT-pickup-comparison] which
does a side-by-side comparison. Besides the sound, the other impact your choice
of pickups will have is whether the body will be routed with a narrow or wide
space for the intended pickup. There are ways to adapt for whatever cavity you
make so in the future you can still change your mind. Though it'll just make
switching a bit more complicated.
