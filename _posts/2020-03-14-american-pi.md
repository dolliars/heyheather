Hey Heather, it's me again.

I saw [this video on Numberphile][YT-indiana-pi] about how the state of Indiana
tried to redefine [π][wiki-pi] as 3.2 back in 1897. Now if this already sounds
irrational to you then the next bit will seem bonkers. The man who came up with
this "*proof*" wanted to copyright it so that anyone who would use the proof
would have to pay him royalties, with the exception of the state of Indiana if
they adopted the proposed bill #246. [The Wikipedia article][wiki-indiana-pi] on
the bill says :

> the main result claimed by the bill is a method to square the circle, rather
> than to establish a certain value for the mathematical constant π, the ratio
> of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

While the bill doesn't directly say that π should be changed, his proof does
implicitly indicate it. You can read the [text of the bill here][text-bill-246].
In section 2 it says that "the ratio of the diameter and circumference is as
five-fourths to four" so 4 ÷ 5/4, which is 3.2. After passing in the House of
Representatives, the bill was mocked and rejected by the Senate. Apparently the
Senate made bad puns and mocked it for half an hour. I searched a bit and
couldn't find if any of the mocking had been transcribed somewhere.

While reading on this I learned that the letter "π" is actually the first letter
of the Greek words "περιφέρεια" 'periphery' and "περίμετρος" 'perimeter'.
