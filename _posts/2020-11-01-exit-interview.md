Hey Heather, it's me again.

So I've been meaning to write for a while but it's been difficult. For many
reasons which I won't lament about here. At least not at the moment. That said,
today I'm writing about exit interviews. You can skip the context and go to [how
I handled the situation](#how-to-escape-the-interview) if you just care about
that.

## Context

A few years ago, I was asking myself a series of existential questions.
Eventually I decided I was unhappy with my current situation and had to leave my
job. Coincidentally, a colleague had decided the same a week prior (off by one
as developer logic dictates). This meant that I witnessed the process my
colleague went through before hand and let me tell you, I did *not* want to go
through *that*. Let me explain what happened.

So when you work for a large boat institutionâ„¢, the general process for leaving,
at least in my experience, is as follows:

1. You have a meeting with your manager to announce you're leaving
2. You hand them a letter or send an email specifying last day
3. You have an exit interview with HR

This all seemed fine to me until I saw the state my colleague was in after their
exit interview. Without going into specifics I'll just say that during the
interview, HR persistently asked [leading questions](wiki-leading-q) so that the
answers would have it seem like the primary reason for leaving was a personal
matter and not organizational problems. ...

what. the. hell. man.

What's even the point of skewing this type of information? I don't know what
type of incentives or motivations HR has but this type of institutional
behavior is insidious. Not only does this conceal internal problems, but it also
damages trust with current employees. People talk.

After seeing how distraught my colleague was after the meeting, I got anxious
and was not looking forward to the invitation. Once I received the invite, I
shared my concern with my manager who said something along the lines of "just do
it". ... *whoosh*.

This was not the support I needed. So this is what I did instead.

## How to escape the interview

I reached out to HR by email asking them if it was necessary to have the exit
interview and if instead we could find another arrangement. No reply. I was
worried and anxious about it. Then I remembered: 

I am an adult and you can't make me. 

The relationship I have with an organization is a professional relationship and
therefore that was how I approached my subsequent actions.

Since I didn't get a reply to my questions, I declined the invitation and wrote
an email stating that I was not going to partake in the in-person exit interview
but that I would answer questions in writing if they wished to send any. Almost
immediately HR reached out saying they really preferred to talk. I reiterated
that I was declining and that I would answer questions in writing. They
eventually sent a link to an questionnaire. That was basically it.

## Writing as evidence

An important takeaway from this experience was that it's better to have things
in writing. If the information is being filtered through another person, it'll
probably have some of their interpretation injected into it. Leading questions
are also less likely to appear in questionnaires. 

I'd also recommend keeping a copy of the questions and answers, as well as
copies of all your correspondence with HR and management. You can BCC and
forward emails to your personal inbox so that you have copies if you need to
refer to them after you've left.
