Hey Heather, it's me again.

I've been thinking a lot about the situation that's going on with COVID-19 and
have been asking myself a bunch of questions in regards to how we could try to
mitigate some of the negative impacts. The way I think of these problems is with
the frame "Given the goal X and the current technologies they have, this
institution could do Y". You'll probably be able to find counter arguments for
suggestions I'm making but this is mostly to get the ideas out of my head. Maybe
some could be useful. Regardless, they probably won't take into account edge
cases or maybe I'll forget something obvious. Anyway, trying to take everything
into account would make the ideas too rigid and you wouldn't be able to apply
them. Given the current situation, we need to be able to adapt faster.

With all that said, what is the current goal? Keep people away from each other.
We want to reduce the number of intersection points between people.

## Supermarkets and pharmacies, stores in general

Currently supermarkets and pharmacies are still open to the public. The problem
with this is that you have a very high number of intersection points between
people. Imagine an aerial view of a supermarket or pharmacy as a grid. And each
customer that visits traces a certain path. From entrance, to items and then
exit passing by a register. Maybe some pressed a few tomatoes to check ripeness.
Maybe you squeeze an avocado or two. Maybe you pick up a can of soup and then
put it back. How many people have you intersected with? Everyone's trail
overlaps at some point, whether it's just at the entrance and exit. And then ask
yourself how many people did they intersect with before going to the store?

Now what can you do? I'd suggest closing the doors, but not the store per se.
Before 1916, [grocery store transactions][wiki-grocery] used to be over the
counter. You would ask the grocer for something and he would get it from the
inventory. Now if we go back to this model we still have the problem of large
groups of people assembling in lines. Well in 1876 a patent for something called
the telephone was awarded to Alexander Graham Bell. We could use this
technology. Stores aren't set up to handle a large influx of calls so we need to
come up with a way to organize this quickly. Since we won't be able to set up
new phones systems for this situation the best way I can think of handling this
would be for employees to use they're own phones. You can't just announce a
series of phone numbers and publish them. That wouldn't work. Well every store
has at least one number that is public so that's the one you can announce to
customers and it'll be the initial point of contact (IPC). This IPC will be used
to take down the customer's name, phone number and postal code. Here are the
steps I'm proposing:

1. Advertise initial point of contact (IPC) for customers to call letting them
   know that they'll be leaving their name, phone number and postal code, and
   that someone will call them back. (Important to let them know that no credit
   card or banking information will be asked by phone at any point in time. You
   don't want fraudsters to take advantage of this situation.)
2. After designated employees block their phone number from displaying when
   making outgoing calls have them call customers back and take down their
   grocery list and address.
3. Have another set of employees take this list and go pickup the groceries.
4. Call the customers back to confirm which items were available and the price
   of the order.
5. Set up either delivery or pickup for groceries.

You may be wondering why you would ask for the postal code right off the bat.
The reasoning behind this is that stores will probably need to primarily handle
locals. It wouldn't be viable if the St-Henri Super C were to cater to someone
living on the Plateau. I'd assume stores would specify the postal codes that
they serve. This would be the first parameter to help with overwhelming demand.
The second would be to ask people to call on specified days in regards their
civic address. If your address is an even number, then you can call on even
days. If your address is an odd number, then call on an odd number. Stores will
have a limited number of orders they'll be able to fulfill in a day and they'll
need to figure out what that is so they can be upfront with customers and manage
their expectations.

Another consideration institutions will need to make is in regards to the use of
employees phones. Since everyone will have different service providers and
plans, they'll need to decide how to reimburse the employees. The simplest way
would be to offer to reimburse the monthly service fee and charges of employees
who use their phone to contact customers. There could also be an agreement taken
with service providers later on. But we're looking at immediate action.
Reimbursement of monthly service fee seems the quickest incentive.

In regards to having employees pick up list items. Decisions on how to go about
it will need to be made. Do you take orders in the morning, and in the afternoon
prepare them? What if you're out of a product? Will there be a minimum on
orders? Will you call the customer for substitution or just let them know you
were out of the requested item? A lot of these questions will come up as things
are happening since you might not be able to think of every case. Therefore
there will need to be a person in charge who can answer the questions as they
come in, and that can document and dispatch the information to those making the
calls and preparing the orders. 

Once the items are prepared, there will have to be a way to get the items into
customer's hands. Will they pick it up or will it be delivered? How will
customers pay for items if the order is to be delivered? Will you support cash
transactions? Who will deliver the item? If you have people just pick up their
order, you still have a lot of intersections between people, but less than if
they the customers had gone to pick up the items themselves. If you deliver the
items you need a method of payment set up. Will you accept checks? An
e-transfer? This all seems a bit more complicated than having people come by and
pick up the groceries. However again the aim is to reduce intersections. From
what I've read, here in Montreal, taxis have been having trouble getting
customers. Maybe there could be an agreement reached between pharmacies,
supermarkets and the taxi industry. Supermarkets and pharmacies can add a fee as
an item to the customer's bill. This amount should already include the tip as to
avoid having to input an amount on the payment terminal and you can just tap
your card. Ideally there would be no cash transactions.

IGA already has a website where you can order online. However older people may
have difficulties using it and I don't think other supermarkets or pharmacies
have this sort of system in place. This is the best I could come up with having
thought about it for a bit. And maybe this could be partially implemented. This
could be a service added and offered to people over the age of 45 for instance.

The problems I see with this proposal are as follows:
- the IPC will be the main bottle neck, hundreds of people calling one number
  that is not setup for large influx of calls
- all stores will have a limit capacity of handling and fulfilling orders (an
  option could be to hire temporary employees)
- this may generate many complaints as to the items selected or the overall
  service

One thing that everyone will need to exercise is patience. Patience and empathy.
People are worried. When you see empty shelves and long lines, when you watch
the news and get updates every 5 minutes on the number of cases rising (which
they will continue to do so), people get anxious even though water will continue
running and there's no expected food shortage. A lot of digital ink has been
spilled over the frenzy surrounding toilet paper but I think the backlash misses
the point. You could've written as much about tampons probably. The point is
that people want to avoid going to store in the coming months so they stock up
on different things. Maybe providing people with a delivery system from their
local supermarket would help. It would also be easier to set limits on items by
saying "I'm sorry, there is currently a limit of X packages of Y item per
household". Another way that you can help people with out of stock or limited
items is to manage expectations "We're expecting a delivery after X date" and
making sure to leave enough buffer for unexpected delays. The important thing
here is to tell the truth to the customers. The truth is reassuring. If you
don't have an item and don't expect it anytime soon, let them know. You can
offer alternatives too. Or let them know the frequency of your deliveries. Sure
you don't have Honey Nut Cheerios now, but you're getting a delivery of dried
oats tomorrow! People won't necessarily be happy but at least they won't fear a
general food shortage. 

## Work

A lot of people can work from home. No matter what corporate has been trying to
convince itself of, you can probably work from home. This isn't a luxury
everyone has, but a lot do and it's unfortunate that some large institutions are
in denial.

## Socializing

I generally don't go out much if at all. I did have plans that were thankfully
postponed though. Had they not been I probably would've justified my decision to
participate. Which just convinces me that we all justify whatever selfish acts
we do by excusing ourselves "it's fine, it'll be fine.. Just this one time".
We're very good at that. The point is that people will look to hang out in some
way and will want to socialize. You give them the opportunity and they will use
it and justify whatever decision they make. So how do we deal with this? A lot
of people have recommended video chat or phone calls. Those are good ideas but
part of the "sharing" aspect is missing in a way. What I mean by this is that if
you meet at a bar, well you can talk about the bar, your order or other things
you and the others interact with in that environment. So maybe adding some sense
of novelty to a video chat would be good. The first step would be to plan the
date and time of the call. And then to specify a topic of discussion. Here are a
few thoughts that may be inspiring:

- Everyone watches a movie before the chat and then you discuss it
- Make a cocktail and explain it to the others
- Prepare a dish you've never tried before and have it during the video chat.
  You can explain it to others (unless your friends have
  [misophonia][wiki-misphonia], in that case don't do this)
- Have everyone read a text and then discuss it
- Everyone prepares something short to read and then you discuss it, or just say
  what you liked about it.
- Solve or attempt to solve a Project Euler or Advent of Code problem and then
  discuss it with others
- Have everyone go and buy the same wine or same beer and have a remote tasting
- Have everyone follow a YouTube tutorial and then show the results
- You can probably do a board game remotely, Pandemic seems appropriate
- ...

If you have a large group video chat, maybe plan to go around to everyone. I've
never had large group chat but I guess it's probable that some people talk more
and others are worried about interrupting. Others may be fine with just
listening too so don't put too much pressure on them to share.

Latency may make video calls annoying, so maybe just calling people on the
phone. There's also Slack. You can set up a time and date and then go chat.
Maybe setup a Google Sheet. You can program colors to specific input and make
that into a chat document. Why you may ask. I'd say, *Why not?* Does ICQ still
exist? You could use ICQ. Remember the typing sound. That was nice.

## What I'm worried about

Ventilators. I'm worried about a shortage in ventilators. In this case, I'm not
sure how health services would deal with a shortage. If they don't have enough
[machines][wiki-medical-ventilators], will they use a [bag valve
mask][wiki-bag-valve-mask] ? The answer to this should be yes. If they retort
"We don't have enough medical staff", to that I say that's not good enough. If a
family member of mine needs a ventilator and the only thing available is a bag
valve mask, you best believe I'm learning how to use one and manually pumping
air into their lungs. I wouldn't ask a medical professional to do this because
of course they'll need to tend to others. But if manually pumping air for a time
is required then I can do that. No one wants it to come to this, but if our
resources are limited, then we have to think this way. What if you can't get an
extra machine? If we know what the problem is and the proper and convenient
machines are not available, what then? If a bag valve mask is available I can
take the time to pump air.

And then what if there are no more bag valve masks? This question has made me
try to come up with a way to make a bag valve mask at home. What could I use to
make one? Since this disease affects the respiratory system, and medical
professionals fear there will be a lack of equipment that deals with theses
issues then what is the most basic equipment we can make? How many people do you
need that can manually pump on rotation? How many days will they need to do
this? Who can do this? I'm young enough that if I get sick, I should be fine.
Although, history with asthma has me doubting this a bit. Regardless exposing
myself to help a family member in need is something I'm willing to do since I
have a higher chance of survival.

I'm not sure what the answers to a lot of these questions are and if any of this
is actually realistic. But if we have people trying to think of solutions to
mitigate problems we might be able to save a few lives.
